Our objective is to deliver a working. We don't want to waste a bunch of time over-optimizing. I would rather see results than obsessing over warnings.

The requirements.md file will describe the requirements for this project. These act as a reference, but not all prompts require ensuring the project is perfectly in line with it. I will refer to it when working together on developing features. But we want to deliver in small chunks, preferring back and forth communication and making small, iterative changes to sweeping refactors.
