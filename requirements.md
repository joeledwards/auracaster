# Requirements

We are building an Auracast server that will broadcast one or more audio streams over a Bluetooth 5.2+ device (targeting support a USB device in our development work).

We will be using Rust as the programming language targeting Linux systems.

The initial implementation will be based on configuration files, having no user interface (graphical or terminal).

We want to support multiple audio streams that are optionally password protected.
